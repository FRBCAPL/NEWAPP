## Safe Removal Methods

### Option 1: Database Direct Access
```sql
-- MongoDB/Database cleanup
db.ladder_players.deleteOne({_id: ObjectId("68b69a7e88d66cd1f4848904")});
db.ladder_players.deleteOne({_id: ObjectId("68b69a8088d66cd1f484890b")});

-- Or by email
db.ladder_players.deleteOne({email: "laddertest-challenger-1756797565714@example.com"});
db.ladder_players.deleteOne({email: "laddertest-defender-1756797565714@example.com"});
```

### Option 2: Admin Panel (if available)
1. Access admin interface
2. Go to ladder player management
3. Search for emails containing "laddertest-"
4. Delete both test users

### Option 3: API Endpoint (when implemented)
```bash
# These endpoints need to be implemented
DELETE /api/ladder/admin/player/68b69a7e88d66cd1f4848904
DELETE /api/ladder/admin/player/68b69a8088d66cd1f484890b
```

## âœ… Safety Confirmation

- **Test data is clearly identifiable** (laddertest- prefix)
- **No real user data was affected**
- **Test users are at the end of the ladder** (positions 51-52)
- **Removing them will not affect existing player positions**

## ðŸ“Š Impact of Leaving Test Data

**Low Impact - Safe to leave temporarily:**
- Test users are clearly marked
- They're at the bottom of the ladder
- They have 0 matches played
- They don't affect existing player rankings

**When convenient, remove via:**
- Admin panel access
- Database management tool
- Future admin API endpoint
